RockmanEXE-NetNavi-Assistant is a Python-based, voice-activated AI assistant inspired by the NetNavis from the Megaman.EXE universe. It uses speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and text-to-speech to engage in natural, voice-driven interactions. The assistant provides context-aware responses, can set reminders, discuss the weather, and remain active until you say "exit" or a similar command. It’s an early-stage prototype aiming to emulate a NetNavi-like companion experience.

## Key Features
- **Voice Interaction:** Uses `SpeechRecognition` and a microphone to listen and respond in real-time.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Employs `TextBlob` to gauge user emotion (happy, neutral, sad, angry) and tailor responses.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Utilizes `pyttsx3` to deliver spoken replies, making the interaction feel natural and conversational.
- **Contextual Responses:** Capable of responding to specific keywords (e.g., "weather", "reminder", "play music") and offers a dynamic, mood-based response system.
- **Virtual Environment Setup:** Automatically creates and configures a Python virtual environment, installing all required dependencies.
- **Automatic System Dependencies (Arch-based):** Attempts to install required system packages (like `python-pyaudio` and `espeak-ng`) on Arch-based systems for seamless setup.

## World Models

This repository includes a set of JSON files in the `world_models` directory, each representing a distinct personality inspired by legendary Mega Man characters.

## How to Use These Profiles:

Save each JSON snippet as a separate file (e.g., medical_advisor.json, legal_advisor.json, financial_advisor.json, teacher.json, president.json) into your world_models directory.
At startup, choose one of these files instead of the default personality.
The assistant will then adopt the style, tone, and domain context provided by that file.
You can further refine responses, integrate domain-specific data sources, or add disclaimers and references as needed for the chosen persona.


  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later recommended
- A microphone and speakers/headphones for voice interaction
- On Arch-based Linux systems (e.g., Steam Deck), `sudo` privileges to install system packages if needed.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RockmanEXE-NetNavi-Assistant.git
   cd RockmanEXE-NetNavi-Assistant

2. Run the Script:

bash
```
python rockman-exe-Net-Navi.py
```

## The script will:

Create a virtual environment in env/ if not present.
Add site-packages to sys.path.
Upgrade pip, wheel, and setuptools.
Install required Python libraries (pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, textblob, pyaudio).
If on Arch, attempt to install python-pyaudio and espeak-ng from system packages if needed.
Once set up, the assistant will start listening.

## Usage
Speak commands into your microphone.
The assistant analyzes your sentiment and responds accordingly.
Say keywords like "weather" to get a weather-related response, "reminder" to set a reminder, or "play music" to simulate playing music.
To stop the assistant, say "exit" or "don't need it anymore."
Troubleshooting
Missing system dependencies: The script tries to install them automatically. If issues persist, manually install the packages as prompted.
Microphone or TTS issues: Ensure your microphone is recognized by SpeechRecognition and that espeak-ng is installed for pyttsx3.
Roadmap
Integrate real weather APIs for accurate reports.
Implement a reminder system that stores and recalls reminders over time.
Add more natural language understanding with advanced NLP frameworks.
Allow customization of voice, speech rate, and responses.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Before contributing, consider discussing major changes via issues to ensure alignment with the project’s direction.
